Example for tree visualisation with [treant.js](https://fperucic.github.io/treant-js/)
and sorting & filtering of tables with [list.js](http://listjs.com).

## Project Structure
- `resources/root.csv` contains root elements of trees which are shown a table with
  links to the respective trees.
- `resources/tree.csv` lists children of each node of a tree.
- `resources/node.csv` and `resources/leaf.csv` contain some additional data
  for tree elements.

## Remark
In Chrome `index.html` cannot be viewed locally, Chrome does not allow
reading data from files on the filesystem. It can be opened in Firefox though.
